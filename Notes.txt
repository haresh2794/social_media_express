How to stay organized in in routing the site?
 - Create a seperate Router
 - router.js
 - in router.js
   const express = require('express')
   const router = express.Router() // this will initiate the express router app
 - then we can create the routers
 - in the server file or the app.js we will put the command  --- 
    const router = require('./router')
    app.use('/',router)
 - IMPORTANT in router.js we must put the exporter command.   module.exports = router

Why we use controllers folder?
 - We need to only have the routes in the router file and the functions should be in a seperate file.
 - It seems unecessary but is very important. It is the middleman that tells what to model and view and gets the routes signal. 
 it converts the network req and covert them to appropriate commands for models(logics on data) and views and then pass the relevant data.

Why we need a model folder?
 - Here for example for registering we need a seperate process like username approval checking email verification. and 
  we cannot give all these logics in the controller folder and therefore we need a model folder to handle the
  logics
 - We include all the business logics for the data. rules that we enforce on a data. Modeling the data. 
 (Email size, username lentgh etc)

What is MVC?
 - Model view controller, It is a standard to organize the data. But is not really compulsory. We built the first app with 
 no Orginization. But that leads to headache when reffered again.
